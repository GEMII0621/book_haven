                            the hearts of all who live in their community and beyond!

                            parent's passion for reading! It has been engrained into her heart! As she says,

                            Salinger. This happened to be Grace's favorite novel as well! As Clark says, "As a young boy,
                            the stories I have read always led me on great adventures and hidden treasures. But I never 
                            dreamed that they would lead me to the greatest adventure and treasure of all time! My

                            veins of my parents and grandparents. But, after reading <i>Women Who Run With The Wolves</i> I was
