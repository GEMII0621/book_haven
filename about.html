                    <td class="description">Edward and Suzanne have been hapily married for over 50 years! 
                        Their passion for literature led them to opening the doors of their bookstore over 
                        40 years ago. This same passion is what drives them to keep their doors open. Their 
                        hopes and desires are that they can instill a love for reading and literature into 
                        the hearts of all who live in their community and beyond!

                    <td class="description"><b>Grace:</b>Manages the ins and outs of Book Haven's logistical 
                        and financial needs. Yet, being Edward and Suzanne's only daughter, she shares her 
                        parent's passion for reading! It has been engrained into her heart! As she says, 
                        "The words of every author I have read runs through my veins, and give life!" <br>
                        <b>Clark:</b>Is responsible for the interior and exterior design and layout of the 
                        ookstore. He is also responsible for the design and implementation of Book Haven's website. 
                        Clark is Grace's husband, and they actually met in this very bookstore when Grace was 
                        assisting Clark with finding a copy of his favorite book, "The Catcher in the Rye" by J. D. 
                        Salinger. This happened to be Grace's favorite novel as well! As Clark says, "As a young boy,
                        the stories I have read always led me on great adventures and hidden treasures. But I never 
                        dreamed that they would lead me to the greatest adventure and treasure of all time! My 
                        Beautiful wife Grace!"

                        Administration and Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Leadership, with a focus on e-commerce.

                        well as expanding the digital presence of Book Haven in order to spread the love of books 
                        across the globe! Rose says, "I grew up with the same love of books that runs through the 
                        veins of my parents and grandparents. But, after reading 'Women Who Run With The Wolves' I was
                        inspired to become a woman who is not afraid to lead in a world of male leaders! I want to 
                        give this same inspiration to women all over the world!" <br><br> Levi is responsible for 
                        stocking and reshelving all of the stores literature items and merchandise, but is always 
                        willing to step away from his duties to assist a customer with their needs. He is also in 
                        charge of booking authors who are local and national on book tours. He also books local

                        for books lead me to a love for the arts as a whole!"
