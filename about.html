                        literature led them to opening the doors of their bookstore over 40 years ago. This same passion is what drives them to keep their doors open. Their hopes and desires are 
                        that they can instill a love for reading and literature into the hearts of all who live in their community and beyond!

                        favorite book, "The Catcher in the Rye" by J. D. Salinger. This happened to be Grace's favorite novel as well! As Clark says, "As a young boy, the stories I have read always led me on great 
                        adventures and hidden treasures. But I never dreamed that they would lead me to the greatest adventure and treasure of all time! My Beautiful wife Grace!"</p>

                        love of books that runs through the veins of my parents and grandparents. But, after reading 'Women Who Run With The Wolves' I was inspired to become a woman who is not afraid to lead in a world of 
                        male leaders! I want to give this same inspiration to women all over the world!" <br><br> Levi is responsible for stocking and reshelving all of the stores literature items and merchandise, but is always
